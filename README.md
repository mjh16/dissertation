# Michael Healy's Dissertation Digital Appendix
This appendix is organized in the following ways:
- First, you can use any of the available folder links above to browse the code and visualizations
- A curated selection of visualizations and code are below.

# Jupyter Notebook Python Programs
The annotated code for the different visualizations is available below.

- [Keyword Parser](https://github.com/mjh16/dissertation/blob/main/notebooks/keyword_parser.ipynb)
- [Corpus Techne Impressions](https://github.com/mjh16/dissertation/blob/main/notebooks/bokeh%20visualizations%20techne%20absences%20corpus%20150.ipynb)

## Keyword Impressions
- [Invention](https://github.com/mjh16/dissertation/blob/main/notebooks/bokeh%20visualizations-%20invention.ipynb)
- [Creativity](https://github.com/mjh16/dissertation/blob/main/notebooks/bokeh%20visualizations-creativity.ipynb)
- [Imagination](https://github.com/mjh16/dissertation/blob/main/notebooks/bokeh%20visualizations-imagination.ipynb)
- [Techne](https://github.com/mjh16/dissertation/blob/main/notebooks/bokeh%20visualizations-techne.ipynb)

# Visualizations
I have worked to link the visualizations in an interactive form below. I have also worked to make the visualizations show the interpreted topic, and to render the data table on the page as well.

The interactive visualizations and datatables are [available here](https://mjh16.github.io/dissertation/). Each of of the individual snapshots is listed below:
- [Corpus Impressions](https://mjh16.github.io/dissertation/corpus)
- [Techne Snapshot](https://mjh16.github.io/dissertation/techne)
- [Invention Snapshot](https://mjh16.github.io/dissertation/invention)
- [Creativity Snapshot](https://mjh16.github.io/dissertation/creativity)
- [Imagination Snapshot](https://mjh16.github.io/dissertation/imagination)
