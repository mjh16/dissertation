# Michael Healy's Dissertation Digital Appendix
This appendix is organized in the following ways:
- First, you can use any of the available folder links above to browse the code and visualizations
- A curated selection of visualizations and code are below.

# Jupyter Notebook Python Programs
The annotated code for the different visualizations is available below.

# Visualizations
I have worked to link the visualizations in an interactive form below. I have also worked to make the visualizations show the interpreted topic, and to render the data table on the page as well.
